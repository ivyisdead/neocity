		<h2>My definition of a highway</h2>
		<p>Highway: A road with a speed limit of at least 80km/h (50mph) that has at least two lanes per direction, separated from eachother; said road must not serve bordering properties and all of its crossings must be grade-separated.</p>
		<p><strong>Please keep in mind that this is the definition of a highway that I'll use for my future blog posts. This is <em>not</em> an official definition</strong></p>
