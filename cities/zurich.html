		<h1>Zürich review</h1>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>Zürich is the largest city in Switzerland, with a metropolitan population of 1.83 million. The city center is located north of <strong>Lake Zürich</strong> (<em>Zürichsee</em> in German), between the rivers <em>Sihl</em> and <em>Limmat</em>.</p>

		<h2>Overall feel of the city</h2>
		<p>Zürich is a great city, but sometimes it can feel a bit overwhelming sometimes: in some parts of the city center, cars take up a lot of the space available, so there's a noticeable amount of noise pollution; yet the parts where cars don't take most of the space are very tranquil and walkable. Setting the noise pollution aside, Zürich's lakefront is incredibly beautiful and very nice to walk on.</p>
		<h2>Public Transit</h2>
		<p>In Zürich public transit is hands-down one of the best public transit systems in the world: you can see trams, buses, even <strong>boats</strong>(!) passing every few minutes</p>
		<h3>Trains</h3>
		<p>Zürich's main station (Zürich Hauptbahnhof) is the busiest train station in Switzerland, and it shows! The station is divided in three floors: an overground floor, where most Inter-city trains arrive and two underground ones, where trains from the extensive S-Bahn system arrive; the station functions as an, albeit quite expensive, mall.</p>
