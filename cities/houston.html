		<h1>Houston review</h1>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>Houston is the largest city in the state of Texas, in the south of the United States, with a metropolitan population of almost 6 million. The city is located in the eastern part of Texas.</p>

		<h2>Overall feel of the city</h2>
		<p>The saying "<em>Everything is bigger in Texas</em>" is true and very noticeable in Houston: the highways are wider, the trucks are bigger, the parking lots are huge, the stores and shopping malls are endless; this isn't necessarily a bad thing but it can feel a bit eccessive sometimes, but I assume you get used to it.</p>
		<h3>The people</h3>
		<p>Based on my experience the people are really friendly and you can find a lot of people from many parts of the world, which I didn't see in other American cities.</p>
		<h2>Public Transit</h2>
		<p>Public transit? I barely know her!</p>
		<p>Jokes aside, Houston really needs to work on its walkability and urban planning, I rarely saw buses in most of the city (although I saw a decent amount of streetcars in downtown Houston) and to get virtually anywhere you have to get on one of the highways of Houston.</p>

		<h2>Fun-ness</h2>
		<p>There's a lot to do in Houston: many shopping malls, restaurants, aswell many sports stadiums, which I find to be a good thing.</p>
