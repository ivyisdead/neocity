		<h1>New York City review</h1>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>New York, New York is the biggest city in the United States, with a city population of 8 million and a metropolitan population of over 21 million. The city itself spans across five boroughs: Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn, the Bronx, and Staten Island.</p>
		<h2>Overall feel of the city</h2>
		<p>Ooh... Where to start... I have a lot to say about New York City.</p>
		<p>I visited New York City a few weeks ago, and since I got out of the subway station I was overwhelmed: the noise, the tall buildings, the amount of people and a lot of other small factors. I really liked New York City but I think it has a few things to fix.</p>

		<h2>What I liked</h2>
		<p>Needless to say that in New York City there's a lot of stuff to do, and you'll hardly ever get bored, I find this to be a very positive thing. Another thing I liked is the different kinds of people you see coexisting in NYC: people of different origins, sexual orientations, genders, etc. talking to eachother without any problems.</p>

		<h3>New York Pizza</h3>

		<p>Yummy.</p>
		<h2>What I disliked</h2>
		<p>It's a shame seeing the amount of homeless people sleeping on the streets and the city government doing almost nothing about it, same applies to drug addicts.</p>
		<h3>The New York City subway</h3>
		<p>The New York City subway's network is quite big and the subway will take you to any part of the city... eventually: during my short stay I've dealt with delays, cancellations, and other inconviniences: the subway's infrastructure is extremely dated and lags behind other transport systems in the country; also the subway was filthy and should be taken more care of.</p>
