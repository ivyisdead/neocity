		<h1>Ivy's website</h1>
		<p>Hello and welcome to my website! Here I write about things that peak my interest, for example: computers and programming, transportation infrastructure, cars, video games and much more!</p>
		<p>LASTEST POST: <a href="other/adhd.html">My experiences with ADHD</a></p>
		<h2>The goal for this website</h2>
		There are no goals for this website, though I'll try and write an article at least every two days, just to keep me occupied for the next few months.
		<h2>How I made this website</h2>
		<h3>Languages</h3>
		<p>This website was made completely using HTML and CSS. Nothing Fancy</p>
		<h3>Computer</h3>
		<p>To make this website I've used mostly my laptop, as I like to write <em>on the go</em>, but I've used whatever computer I've got on hand.</p>
		<h3>Camera</h3>
		All pictures on this website (unless stated otherwise) have been taken by me, using my Canon PowerShot A560: a perfectly adequate camera, except for the fact that its CMOS battery is dead and marks every photo taken with as it were to be taken on January 1st, 1980.

		<p>I probably should add some stickers to the camera in order to personalize it and make it <em>mine</em>.</p>
